# lowHighMiddleWithExceptionHandling

In the book, program 16-3 (on page 994) demonstrates how to handle multiple exceptions using a separate class. Use that as a model for this project.

This project asks the user for a low value, a high value, and a value in the middle. It checks that the low value is greater than 0, that the high value is not less than or equal to the low value, and that the middle value is between the low and high values. If any of those checks fails, it throws an appropriate exception and the program asks the user to enter that data again. 

Here is a screenshot of results:

![Ch 16 Low Mid High]()

Run the project once and check all the exceptions, as shown above, and take a screenshot. Run the project again with no errors, and take a screenshot.

![p]() 

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot
